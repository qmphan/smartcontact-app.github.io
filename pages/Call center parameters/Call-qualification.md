## Create Call qualification

This feature is used to create a Call Qualification List that facilitates the work of agents. Once the call qualification list has been programmed, it appears at the end of a call (if the administrator has set this option) and allows the agent to qualify the call with a few clicks.

To set up call qualification, click on "Call center parameters" in the "Call Center" block. Then click on "Call Qualifications" in the drop-down list that appears.

The Call qualification list is displayed as follows::
