## Introduction

Using Outbound campaign, you can upload a csv file containing the contacts to be called. The system will take care of calling contacts in the file when one or some agents become available. You can also set the period of time to make outbound call (i.e beenween 10am and 15pm) and the list of agents who will handle these calls.

## Format of the csv file

In order to make an outbound call, you need a csv file containing all the contact to be called. CSV stands for Comma Separated Values -  a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. You can use Microsoft Excel to generate a CSV file from an excel sheet. The first line of the file must contain the names of each column and the following line contain contact data. Here is an example of the csv file

```
firstname, lastname, enterprise, phone, address
Big, Ben, The Tower, 0101010101, Westminster, London SW1A 0AA, UK
Jean, Pierre, The Startup, 0102020202, Avenue Des Champs-ElysÃ©es, Paris 08, FR
```

## Create an outbound campaign

From campaign management page, click on the button "Create" from the campaign management page.

Fill all the fields in this General tab with the required information.

### Schedule Start Date and Schedule End Date

The day the campaign should begin and the day it should stop. If these values are not defined, the campaign will run as long as there are contacts to be called. You can check the checkbox "Set start time and end time" if you only want the campaign to be active during some period of the day.

### Campaign Type:

Campaign type can take 2 values:
1. Call agent first: The system will try to call agent first. Only when agent has anwsered, the system will call the client. This mode should be preferred if you want to make sure the client will have an agent available when he/she picks up the call.
2. Call client first: In this mode, the system will call the client first, then play an IVR while searching for an available agent. Do not use this mode unless you are sure that the called contacts would accept to wait to talk to an agent.

## Upload contact to be called to the newly created campaign

From campaign edit page, click on the tab "Contact to be called", then click on "Import from csv". The upload csv dialog will shown as bellow.
