## Eavesdrop

Can I listen to or participate in a real time agent call?

Yes, this is called "double listening" and can be done from the "Live Call & Agent Info" tab of the "Control Panel". Current calls and connected agents are accessible via this page.

In the list of calls in progress, click the button "Eavesdrop" to attend the call. However, you will not be able to intervene but only listen:

A window appears and prompts you to enter your phone number to receive the call and listen.
